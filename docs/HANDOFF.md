# Continuation handoff

## Starting checkpoint

Baseline: `b5efe3f`, main after PRs #1 through #14. The working tree was clean and
all seven CI jobs passed. Local validation recorded 422 pytest cases, 11 Node
controller tests, and 78% line coverage across the source, API, and CLI.
Desktop and mobile browser fixtures cover authentication, queue/cancellation,
history, source model selection, and exports. See [validation](VALIDATION.md)
for limits on those measurements.

The repository has a shared CLI/API pipeline, conservative evidence handling,
scope and transport enforcement, a durable SQLite queue, passive MCP assessment,
offline replay, report comparison, and expiring suppression policies. The broader
milestones in [the engineering plan](ENGINEERING_PLAN.md) remain partially complete.

## Next delivery sequence

### 1. Make discovery failure and resource identity reliable

Own cloud inventory and traffic parsing in separate scoped commits. Parse URLs
and structured records, bound file and SDK pagination work, preserve stable
resource identities, and expose unavailable or failed sources without losing
successful observations. Cloud resources require resource-specific identity;
a shared provider runtime URL cannot identify several deployed models.

Acceptance: positive and negative HAR/JSON/text fixtures, spoofed-host rejection,
no credential retention, stable repeated discovery, bounded reads/pagination,
missing SDK and provider failures distinct from successful empty inventory.
SDK fixtures run without real provider accounts.

### 2. Complete the scan and check contracts

Introduce typed scan, asset, finding, and evidence records and versioned check
records while preserving existing JSON/SARIF consumers. Record execution and
oracle outcomes explicitly. A missing finding can be resolved only when the same
versioned check actually passed for the same unambiguous asset.

Acceptance: skipped prerequisites, rejected requests, failures, and heuristic
signals cannot become passed checks; genuine protected-canary checks record their
outcome; CLI/API snapshots and report comparison consume the same contract;
existing version 1.0 reports remain readable.

### 3. Version SQLite upgrades and persist audit history

Add transactional schema versioning for known existing layouts and safe fresh
initialization. Acquire exclusive dispatcher ownership before migration/recovery.
Persist admission, claim, cancellation, and terminal audit events in the same
transaction as each state transition. Expose bounded tenant-owned audit history.

Acceptance: fresh and known legacy upgrades preserve rows; unknown/future schemas
fail before writes; interrupted upgrades roll back; repeated calls do not duplicate
transitions; cancellation cannot leave inconsistent terminal job/session/report
states. Audit records contain only operational identifiers, states, and timestamps.
This history is not a tamper-resistant audit system.

## Verification and review

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
ruff check .
bandit -r src app.py scanner_cli.py cli.py -ll
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
sh scripts/package-smoke.sh dist/*.whl
```

Use the existing virtual environment when available. Independent reviewers should
exercise regression cases and inspect failure paths. Every implementation PR must
pass the current Python matrix, lint, dependency audit, package, and container
checks before merge. Follow [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for Git identity and delivery.

Do not reuse stale implementation branches without checking their contents.
Earlier agent worktrees remain on old branches; create a fresh worktree from the
latest merged main for new work. Temporary browser artifacts from the first phase
are supporting evidence, not required repository dependencies.

## Later milestones

After these slices, continue scoped live lab adapters and stronger discovery
fixtures, scheduling/templates and selected integrations, then representative
accuracy, load/soak, accessibility, and upgrade acceptance. Enterprise identity,
PostgreSQL/distributed execution, and external deployments need explicit supported
contracts and their own validation. Keep unimplemented capabilities visible in
the plan and product documentation.

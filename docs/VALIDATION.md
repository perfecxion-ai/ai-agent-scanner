# Engineering validation checkpoint

Date: 2026-10-13. This records the beta build-out, not a release certification.
The first checkpoint followed PRs #1 through #14. PRs #15 through #22 add
discovery, check contracts, SQLite upgrades/audit history, local queue acceptance,
and dashboard evidence views. None of these merges publishes a package.

## Automated checks

- Local Linux/Python 3.10.20: 518 pytest cases passed. The suite invokes 25 Node
  controller tests, which also passed independently.
- Line coverage across `src`, `app`, and `scanner_cli`: 86%. The shared pipeline
  is 95%, transport 95%, durable jobs 91%, schema acceptance 94%, and API 91%.
  Mocked cloud inventory is 92% and traffic parsing 89%. This measures executed
  source lines, not attack coverage or security effectiveness.
- Ruff and the configured medium/high-severity Bandit gate pass, including API
  source. Lower-severity static findings still require contextual review.
- Real loopback HTTP fixtures exercise provider request formats, rejected probes,
  canary disclosure versus refusal, and credential removal from JSON/SARIF output.
- Real SQLite transactions exercise competing claims, cancellation/finalization
  races, restart recovery, and exclusive dispatcher ownership.
- Known legacy schema upgrades preserve rows; unknown layouts, future versions,
  defaults, triggers, views, and unexpected unique constraints are rejected before
  writes. Interrupted upgrade transactions roll back. State changes and bounded
  tenant audit events persist atomically.
- Versioned check regressions distinguish passed/confirmed evidence from
  heuristic, inconclusive, failed, and skipped execution. New risk requires
  conclusive completed evidence; verified resolution requires exact probe,
  provider/model, and public evidence-context matches for every earlier occurrence.
- Distribution build, metadata validation, isolated installed-wheel commands,
  and offline evaluation smoke pass outside the checkout.
- Container build, readiness, and readiness after restart pass.

CI repeats tests and wheel checks on Python 3.10 through 3.13, audits installed
dependencies including cloud/server extras, runs lint/source security checks,
and builds and starts the container. Check each PR's latest run for its exact
commit and dependency resolution; this document is not a substitute for CI.

## Browser verification

Chromium was exercised against a loopback Flask server with real authentication,
SQLite queue, history, cancellation, and export routes. Discovery and security
phases used synthetic fixtures; no external target was scanned.

The initial workflow covers invalid/valid login, memory-only session state, discovery,
source model selection, separate findings/observations, unassessed risk, history,
JSON/SARIF downloads, cancellation, missing scans, and logout. Desktop 1440-pixel
and mobile 390-pixel layouts were visually inspected without horizontal overflow.
The native fetch receiver failure found in this test now has a regression test.

The continuation fixture adds versioned check outcomes, skipped/failure reasons,
inconclusive and historical unassessed risk, cloud resource identities, real
transactional audit history, literal HTML-like fields, and exports despite an
unavailable audit route. It also verifies logout clearing and the absence of
page errors, external requests, and CSP violations. Discovery/security functions
remain synthetic; this does not validate a real model's behavior.

## Local queue acceptance

The default 200-job disposable SQLite workload passed with two workers:
179 completed, 20 cancelled, one interrupted, 181 unique claims, 582 audit events,
and consistent job/session/report states. A repeated integrated run took
7.987785 seconds (22.409 completed jobs/second); no throughput threshold is an
acceptance criterion. Four-job acceptance passed and a deliberately insufficient
deadline reported failure. See [performance scope and reproducible commands](performance.md).

Installed AWS, Azure, and GCP SDK method signatures and resource/list schemas were
checked locally, including cloud extras. Tests use mocked responses without
provider credentials or real account requests. Use Python 3.11 or newer for cloud
inventory because the installed Google SDK warns about Python 3.10 support.

## Remaining validation gaps

- Real cloud account inventory and representative capture-format integration
  remain incomplete despite stronger mocked/format fixtures. Network discovery
  line coverage is 44%; representative service/signature negatives remain a gap.
- Provider fixtures do not establish compatibility with every live model or
  account configuration. No paid provider calls were made.
- Replay metrics describe synthetic or supplied labels, not representative
  production precision/recall. Passive MCP checks do not execute tools.
- PostgreSQL, distributed workers, network-filesystem locking, and overlapping
  server reloads are unsupported, not validated deployment options.
- Representative load/soak benchmarks, comprehensive accessibility evaluation,
  deployed upgrade/backup acceptance, enterprise identity, and tamper-resistant
  audit acceptance remain pending. Known SQLite upgrade tests and a synthetic
  queue workload do not close these release-level gaps.
